This respository was built using [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr).

workflowr provides three key initial pages, of which "About" is one of them.

The about page is designed to hold a description of the project.

For example, if this was a respository to support a publication, this page would contain the abstract, the equivalent of the PubMed Abstract.
